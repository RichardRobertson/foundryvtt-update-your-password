# Update Your Password

This module simply adds a new tool to the Token Controls menu which allows players to update their passwords while logged in.

Clicking it will show this very simple dialog.

A password must be typed in twice to confirm before applying. If the two entered passwords do not match, an error will be shown and the password will not be changed.

- It will also prevent you from setting a blank password in this manner as the tabletop does not seem to react to updating the password to nothing.
  - If you want to remove a password, it must be done through the standard game master interface.
